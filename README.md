Linear Regression:
1) Larger the parameters, smaller should the rate be, for the same y set
2) Smaller the rate, larger the number of iterations
3) Larger the number of iterations, more the time
4) Thus, the more varied the parameters, more time it will take
5) Divide the error sum by number of training examples, for avg
