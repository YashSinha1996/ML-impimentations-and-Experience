###Linear Regression:
- Larger the parameters, smaller should the rate be, for the same y set
- Smaller the rate, larger the number of iterations
- Larger the number of iterations, more the time
- Thus, the more varied the parameters, more time it will take
- Divide the error sum by number of training examples, for avg
